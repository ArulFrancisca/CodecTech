## 1️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction
**Goal:** Predict which customers are likely to leave a service.  
**Dataset:** Telecom customer usage and service data.  
**Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, EDA, ROC-AUC evaluation.  
**Insights:** Customers with more service calls or international plans are more likely to churn.

## 2️⃣ Credit Risk Modeling
**Goal:** Predict if a customer is high or low credit risk.  
**Dataset:** Merged `payment_data.csv` (transactions) and `customer_data.csv` (demographics).  
**Techniques:** SMOTE for imbalance, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SHAP for explainability.  
**Insights:** Overdue behavior and payment regularity are strong risk indicators.
